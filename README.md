# NVH's Common Avatar Settings Configuration & Storage System

## Project Overview

This project is to create a common configuration storage system for VRChat and ChilloutVR avatars.
Primarily intended for Avatar Creators the end goal is to have this system be able to hold all required config items,
such that an avatar creator need only distribute one version of an avatar, that can be imported to a unity project by
the end user and be fully usable on either platform.
